## Investment Thesis

  We recommend a **hold** rating for LGIH with a target price of $95.48 for the following reasons:

  - **Seller's Market**: The real estate market is currently a seller's market, so LGIH's value, being heavily tied to real estate, is likely in an expensive phase of the cycle.
  - **Long-term Potential**: Despite the current high valuation, the closeness of the valuation to their actual price and their strong management suggest long-term sustainability.

  ### DCF – Terminal Growth

  The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is calculated based on the assumptions that components of Non-Cash Net Working Capital remain steady as percentages of Revenue, COGS, and Operating Expenses, and that Capital Expenditures continue to grow in the short term before reducing back in the medium term.

  - Current Market Price of LGIH is $98.93 per share, while the DCF model implies a value of $10 per share, suggesting the stock is overvalued by approximately 90%.
  - Enterprise Value (EV) is $3,405 million, accounting for long-term debt and cash equivalents.
  - The Cost of Equity is calculated at 11.88%, influenced by a risk-free rate of 2.38%, market risk premium of 7.0%, and an adjusted beta of 1.36.
  - The WACC is 10.8%, indicating the overall discount rate used for future cash flows.

  ### P/E Relative Valuation

  The P/E relative valuation method compares LGIH's price-to-earnings ratio with that of its peers. This approach considers different market scenarios to provide a comprehensive view of the stock's potential valuation.

  - **Bear Scenario**: EPS of 9.42 with a P/E ratio of 4.21 results in a price of $39.65, indicating a 59.9% undervaluation.
  - **Base Scenario**: EPS of 18.04 with a P/E ratio of 5.48 results in a price of $99.92, indicating the current price is 1.0% overvalued.
  - **Bull Scenario**: EPS of 25.00 with a P/E ratio of 6.50 results in a price of $167.38, indicating a potential 69.2% appreciation.

  The weighted average price, considering 50% weight to the bear scenario, 30% to the base scenario, and 20% to the bull scenario, results in an implied price of $83.28, suggesting that the stock is currently overvalued by approximately 15.8%.
