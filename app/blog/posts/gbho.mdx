## Objective

  The primary goal of this project was to increase brand awareness and customer engagement for Great Blue Heron Outdoors, with a specific focus on the coffee segment of the business.

  Our team undertook an intensive project to enhance brand awareness and customer engagement for Great Blue Heron Outdoors. This project aimed to address the business's need to become more well-known within the local community and increase customer engagement, specifically focusing on their coffee segment. Here's a detailed overview of our approach and findings.

  ### Executive Summary:

  Great Blue Heron Outdoors is a coffee shop and quiet water outfitter that focuses on gear and equipment for activities in and around water like fishing, paddling, camping, duck hunting, or even just hanging out. Opening in August 2021, it is a newer store located on Massachusetts Street in Lawrence, Kansas. Our project focused on enhancing brand awareness and customer engagement, specifically targeting the coffee segment of the business.

  We decided to conduct our survey targeting coffee drinkers, both students and non-students, in Lawrence, Kansas. The survey aimed to find out which drinks the target population enjoys and understand the demographic of coffee drinkers to help Great Blue Heron Outdoors market effectively and increase foot traffic in the store.

  ## Methods

  The purpose of the questionnaire was to provide answers to the research questions. The original questionnaire was pre-tested by sending our draft out to friends to see if there were any errors we were not catching. It was then evaluated and approved by Surya Mantrala, our Marketing Research Professor. The final questionnaire (available in the Appendix) was shared after obtaining recommendations and resolving any issues that arose during the pre-testing phase.

  The questionnaire was made up of 18 questions on an online Google Forms. We sent out the questionnaire virtually to various student group chats like clubs, Greek life, and other class chats. We also reached out to family and friends. The Great Blue Heron was also kind enough to encourage their customers to take the survey in-store by scanning a QR code. This helped us gain more non-student responses and responses from people who had for sure been in the store and were familiar with the brand.

  - Distributed virtually to student groups, friends, and family, and promoted in-store via QR code.

  ## Consumer Preferences

  We wanted to get a better feel for consumer preferences and understand what people look for when they walk into a coffee shop. Initially, we gauged how current customers felt about the quality of the existing drink menu. When asked to rate the quality on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best, participants consistently rated the drinks as 4s and 5s.

  After understanding the satisfaction with the current menu, we explored new drink options that consumers would like to see added. The survey data revealed a strong interest in adding cider, Frappuccinos, limeade, and beer. Notably, the store has already started offering seltzers, craft beers, smoothies, and cider, reflecting consumer preferences.
