  ## DCF – Terminal Growth

  Meta's revenue primarily comes from advertising. The company provides free tools and services to billions of users and monetizes this large user base by selling advertisement space to businesses and leveraging user data. Meta prioritizes increasing Daily Active Users (DAUs) to maximize ad revenue. Innovative features like Instagram Reels and Stories are introduced to retain user engagement and compete with platforms like TikTok and Snapchat.

  <ul className="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2 gap-x-16">
    <li>Current Market Price of Meta is $200 per share, while the DCF model implies a value of $107 per share, suggesting the stock is overvalued by approximately 47%</li>
    <li>Enterprise Value (EV) is $567,718 million, accounting for long-term debt and cash equivalents</li>
    <li>The Cost of Equity is calculated at 9.35%, influenced by a risk-free rate of 2.03%, market risk premium of 5.8%, and an adjusted beta of 1.26</li>
    <li>The WACC is 9.3%, indicating the overall discount rate used for future cash flows</li>

## ARPU – Average Revenue Per User
