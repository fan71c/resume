  In our valuation process, we placed significant emphasis on relative valuation using public comparables to ensure a well-rounded and market-reflective acquisition price for Terracon. We selected a range of comparable companies with similar operational and financial characteristics to Terracon.

  - **EV/EBITDA Valuation:** Our analysis utilized an EV/EBITDA multiple of 13.70x for both the 2023 estimate and the 2027 discounted projection.

After accounting for a 20% discount for being a private company, the adjusted multiple was 0.80x. This resulted in implied enterprise values of $1,893.13 million for 2023 and $1,426.31 million for the 2027 discounted estimate, averaging $1,659.72 million.
